                  <h4>Terms of service. Welcome to Iconist </h4>
                  <p>By using this site’s services, you agree to use them in good faith, in accordance with the terms of service and the laws of the state or country where you use the services.</p>
                  <p>Polyamory Dating (hereinafter: the site), which is based in London, United Kingdom, operates with the aim of encouraging people to adopt polyamorous relationships. We believe that many people can be happier in such relationships, free from the dissatisfaction caused by monogamy, which stands in stark contrast to human nature and is perpetuated by misinformation and social pressure.</p>
                  <p>The site welcomes all sexes, genders, and sexual orientations.</p>
                  <p>The site adheres to the humanistic approach, which places natural human rights, rather than the state, a ruler, or God, at the center.</p>
                  <p>Do not misuse the services provided by the site and do not disrupt them. You may only use them in accordance with the laws of your state or country. We reserve the right to suspend or discontinue services provided to you if you breach the terms of service.</p>
                  <p>Some of the services require a user account. You can create your own account.</p>
                  <p>We may send you administrative messages, service messages, and any other such information in regard to your use of the services. You may request to unsubscribe from these messages.</p>
                  <p>In order to protect your account, please keep your password confidential. You are the sole responsible party for the activity in your account or through it.</p>
                  <p>All content on the site is copyright-protected; however, you may use the content on any other website by giving credit by means of an active link to the homepage</p>
                  <p><b><span class="font-color-blue">Trademark</span></b><br>The logo of this website is a registered trademark.</p>
                  <p><b><span class="font-color-blue">Press inquiries</span></b><br>We can provide articles on the topics of polyamory. Alternatively, we are available for written interviews.
                    For more details, please contact us.
                    The articles on this website may be published elsewhere as long as appropriate credit is given alongside an active link to  www.p.dating.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>These terms of service may be periodically updated.</b></p>
                  <h4>Privacy policy. We protect your privacy</h4>
                  <p>We provide maximum privacy so that you can use the site safely and comfortably.</p>
                  <p>We protect your privacy in seven important ways:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>You can use either your real name or an alias. You can also change your name as many times as you wish.</li>
                    <li>Unregistered users can't see your dating profile.</li>
                    <li>You can block members to prevent them from viewing your profile or messaging you.</li>
                    <li>A system for reporting inappropriate behavior allows members to keep the community safe.</li>
                    <li>We do not trade your information to third parties.</li>
                    <li>You can delete your account, in which case all your information will be permanently deleted.</li>
                    <li>You retain all the rights over your information and content.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Here is a simple explanation on the types of information we gather, how we collect and store it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>
                  <h4>What types of information do we store on the site?</h4>
                  <p><b><span>Guests/visitors:</span></b><br>We do not store any identifying information except for the IP address and Google statistics.</p>
                  <p><b><span>Registered users:</span></b><br>We store the information entered in the registration form: your first name, last name, and email address. If you register through a social network (Facebook or Google+), your first name, last name, and profile photo may be imported over from it, with your consent. This information will be visible on your profile. You can, however, change your name and replace your photo to delete the imported information.</p>
                  <p>Any additional information you may provide, for example in the "About me" section, will be stored to help you create your own profile. You can also create photo albums, which will be visible to registered users. Private messages and comments will also be stored.</p>
                  <p>If you choose to publish a private post, only registered users will be able to read it. If you make it public, it will be freely accessible online, and your name will appear on that page.</p>
                  <p>Blocked accounts: We store the email addresses of blocked users to prevent them from registering again. If your account has been blocked and you want to delete it, please contact us.</p>
                  <p>Reports by users on inappropriate behavior, such as harassing messages or offensive photos, may lead to the reported user's account being blocked. In such cases we will review the reported content.</p>
                  <h4>How do we collect information?</h4>
                  <p>We collect information in two stages. The first is during registration. If you register through a social network (Facebook or Google+), your first name, last name, and profile photo may be imported over from it, with your consent. If you register by filling out the registration form, the information will be that which you provide.</p>
                  <p>The second stage is the creation of your profile page and your activity on the site. We receive the information you type and the photos you upload.</p>
                  <h4>How do we protect your information?</h4>
                  <p>Communications between the website and your computer or mobile device are secured by SSL. In addition, we protect your information using Google's storage services.</p>
                  <p>While we invest substantial resources in protecting the privacy of our users, no system is 100 percent immune to security leaks. If there is any information you want to keep private, simply do not share it on the site.</p>
                  <p>We do not sell or trade your personal information to any third party. To make our service more efficient, some providers may be given access to information for maintenance, development, and security purposes.</p>
                  <h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
                  <p>When you upload, store, send, or receive content on or through our services, you allow the site to use, host, store, copy, alter, derive (such as translate, process, or change in any way to fit your content with our services), inform, publish, and distribute your public content, for example on our homepage. The rights you grant in this license are only used for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our services and developing new services. This license will continue to be in force even if you choose to cease using our services. This does not include your private content, which you have not published publicly. Deleting your private content from the site will permanently delete it.</p>
                  <h4>What are your rights regarding your information?</h4>
                  <p>Your personal information is yours.</p>
                  <p>If you want to permanently delete your account, including all your information and photos, please check out our Help page or contact us, and we will delete the account.</p>
                  <p>If you have found personal information (such as name, picture, address etc.) or copyright protected content, please send us a message, and we will remove these as soon as possible.</p>
                  <p>Some of our services allow you to upload, store, send, or receive content. Rights to own intellectual property for such content will stay with you. In others words, what’s yours is yours.</p>
