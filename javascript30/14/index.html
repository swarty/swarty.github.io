    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let arr1 = Array.from(players),
    		arr11 = players.map((el) => el),
    		arr12 = players.slice(0, players.length),
    		arr3 = [...players];

    console.log(arr1)
    console.log(arr11)
    console.log(arr12)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let obj1 = person;
    console.log(obj1);

    person.name = 'swarty';
    console.log(obj1)
    let obj2 = Object.assign({}, person, {some: 'new line'});
    person.name = 'swarty change';
    console.log(obj2)

    let obj3 = {};

    let masObj = Object.keys(obj2);
    masObj.forEach( element => {
    	obj3[element] = obj2[element];
    })
    console.log(obj3)

    let obj4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj3))
    obj3.name = 'Mama';
    console.log(obj4)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
